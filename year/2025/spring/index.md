## Preamble
I feel way less excited for school this semester than [last semester](../2024/fall/index.md).

At the same time, school seems materially better...so far. I feel like I have adjusted my expectations to be as low as possible, which means I am sometimes pleasantly surprised by moments of joy.

I need to figure out what the [Harriet Network blog](https://harrietnetwork.com/blog) looks like. I'm basically trying to shoehorn all my projects for my classes this semester into work for the [Harriet Network](https://harrietnetwork.com).

And..that's it. That's my grand vision. My scope has decreased. Maybe I will accomplish more if I "scope" smaller and smaller.
