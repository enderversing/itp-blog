# Week 1

I feel that the syllabus is quite straightforward. I like how clear it is, actually.

I'm actually trying to come up with questions. I have a silly question: how was the color scheme for the syllabus chosen? I won't choose that one though.

I actually think turning a walking pad into a generator might be a good idea? I'm inspired by what Audrey said about how wasteful our projects can be, though, and I would like to win the **Most Salvaged Materials** award if possible.

I would like to convert energy from something we already do, day to day, into a source of energy. Thinking about what we talked about in our first class, I should probably harvest energy from an activity that requires the expenditure of a lot of power. I think?


I also know that I want my solar project to be a [repeater](https://www.austinmesh.org/devices/#solar) for the [Harriet Network](https://harrietnetwork.com).

I think my ideas are pretty solid. I'm just struggling to figure out how to salvage materials instead of buying a ton of stuff from Adafruit.

## Questions

1. How do I design with salvaged materials?
2. What can be salvaged, and how?

### Extra questions

3. How do I build a realistic power budget for a project?
4. What methods can reduce the energy consumption of my projects?
5. How do I design projects with intermittent power supplies?
