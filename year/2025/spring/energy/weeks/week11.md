# Week 11

## Solar Project

I have been unable to get my solar project to turn on. I hope my office hours with Jeff will help me fix this.

I'm not sure whether I connected the wires to the breadboard incorrectly, but I asked Shop staff for help. I'm not sure where the point of failure is.

## Final Project

This is what the second prototype looked like before I abandoned it.

I decided that, instead of starting over, I want to modify the first prototype to be wearable (as an add on, not a custom case instead of designing something from scratch.

Voice can be something to work on in the future!

This is what the add-on looks like so far.

## Notes

* The  [Heltec WiFi LoRa 32](https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32-v3/) boards (x2) appear to have been stolen and/or lost in transit.
* The [AEMLIC](https://www.tindie.com/products/jaspersikken/solar-harvesting-into-lithium-ion-capacitor/) boards (x2) have not arrived.
