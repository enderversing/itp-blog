# Week 10

## Conflicting Advice

Resident Kay told us to design our enclosure around alkaline batteries. Professor Knox told us to build a "looks like" prototype that ignores battery requirements.

## Cobalt-Free Power (Maybe)

Jasper reached out to me through multiple channels, offering support on this project after I ordered his AEMSUCA board.

Jasper offered Li-ion capacitors as an alternative to Li-ion batteries without the explosions/fires and cobalt material sourcing. 

Jasper also advised me to switch from the [AEMSUCA](https://www.tindie.com/products/jaspersikken/solar-harvesting-into-supercapacitors/) to the [AEMLIC](https://www.tindie.com/products/jaspersikken/solar-harvesting-into-lithium-ion-capacitor/) board.

## How does voice over LoRa work?

We would reference one of these codebases:
* [LoRa Codec2](https://github.com/dudmuck/lora_codec2)
* [MeshChat](com/liamcottle/reticulum-meshchat)

Voice calls over LoRa are, indeed, theoretically possible.
