# Week 4

## Weekly Reading

I tried to read Chapter 3 of Energy. I did skim through the first few pages. It is dry.

## Kinetic Energy Project

I received a large motor in the mail.


This is a gif in which I use the motor to light up the LED on a Feather M0 with LoRa. 

Open Circuit Voltage: 4-7 V
Current: .7-1.0 A

The gear produces so much torque that I have to crank it with pliers.

The voltage regulator is for 3.3 V but the voltage that comes out of the voltage regulator is 3.27 V (not 3.3 V exactly).
