## Harriet Prototype v1

Watch [this](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHeEGpXJpe1/).

(I can't embed Instagram reels or videos in my Markdown-based SSG.)

We talked to multiple people who experience housing insecurity and found that this protoype might need a different enclosure because:
* electronics are often stolen by others
* electronics are confiscated/stolen by security guards at shelters
* for older members of our community, carrying around a phone feels strange, which makes it easier to forget/lose

In terms of functionality - texting is not a preferred commnication modality because it feels impersonal, and older members of our community just don't know how to do it.

## Harriet Prototype v2

Enclosure should be wearable to make it harder to lose or steal.

Functionality should focus on voice calls instead of texting.


### Prototype v2.1

The original plan:

### Prototype v2.2

The second plan, realizing PCB design is hard:

### Prototype v2.3


The third plan - buy existing development boards with LoRa + Bluetooth capabilities that would connect to existing headphones to enable making phone calls over radio.

Current prototype - purchased:
* [Heltec WiFi LoRa 32](https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32-v3/) (x2)
* Bluetooth (wireless) over-ear headphones with mic (x1)


Current prototype - in progress:

* custom-built Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 enclosure (x2)
  * circle / rectangle base with two hooks (like a smart watch)
    * hooks can be smushed down or pulled out depending on intended use case
    * can be attached to:
      * keychain
      * necklace
      * watch chain
      * hair clip
      * headphones
* power supply for Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 development board (x2)
  * ~~hoping it is possible to siphon the charge of the Bluetooth headphones (it isn't...)~~
  * hoping that my desired supercapacitor + votlage regulator power supply setup is sufficient ~~(probably isn't)~~
    * will try using AAA batteries with VIN (bypass LiPo charger)
