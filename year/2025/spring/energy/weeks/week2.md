# Week 2

1. Choose a generator.
2. Choose how to condition the output of your generator.
3. Sketch the concept. (incomplete)
4. Identify components to find or make.

## Part 1: Choice of Generator

(GPT-4o mini below)

2500mAh = 2.5Ah

Energy (Wh) = 2.5Ah × 3.7V= **9.25Wh**

* I can't find the actual voltage of the koobee k100 battery, so I'm going with the guess of 3.7V for now.
  * The highest koobee replacement battery voltage I saw was 3.87 V, but I think it was for a different model.
* Honestly, I'm not sure how to get to W from Wh, because I seem to need how much power is consumed over a set period of time. If I assume all this is consumed in one hour, *I guess I have **9.25W***?

1Wh = 3600J

Energy (J) = 9.25Wh × 3600J/Wh = **33300J**

## Part 2: Generator Output Conditioning

I am not sure, but I believe that the phone model I am targeting actually uses an AC adapter to charge. I don't know whether I need a rectifier circuit.


## Part 3: Generator Sketch

I feel torn about whether to aim high or just make the simplest possible contraption.

## Part 4: Components to Find/Make

I'm thinking that this might be a huge motor. 

I think I'm looking to make a hand crank with an output current of 2500
    mAh and output voltage of ~3.7 V.

Right now, I need the basics to work.


## Extra: Dreamzoning / Ideation

I like the idea of making this some toy or installation that generates energy, in the future, because I don't want it to be a chore.


I looked up "energy harvesting toy playground" and found [this link](https://our-power.co.uk/energy-generating-playgrounds-turning-fun-into-power/) about merry go-rounds that can generate power.

This hypothetical playground could also have [jumpropes and spinning seats](https://playgroundprofessionals.com/playground/playground-produces-energy). I was already thinking of making a little "game" where you can generate motion by spinning yourself around in a chair.

This could actually go together with my solar project, which I want to be a [repeater](https://www.austinmesh.org/devices/#solar) for the [Harriet Network](https://harrietnetwork.com).

Maybe I could create temporary/portable (or permanent/stationary) playgrounds in public spaces that harvest energy from the sun and from human movement? I don't know. I lack confidence in my ability to follow through...
