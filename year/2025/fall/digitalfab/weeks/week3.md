**Final Project Ideation**

## Keychain Fabrication

I could just fabricate some keychains. Maybe I should aim low.

## Printers

<!-- How are books bound? Could I automate the binding of books/zines with [atypical](https://www.are.na/block/38616693) pages, or automate creating books/zines with [pop-out sections](https://www.are.na/block/12464774)? -->

I *think* my thesis will be related to ([lo-fi](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0129626407003071)) [DNA computing](https://ebooks.iospress.nl/publication/6470) using [xerography (printers)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-540-88869-7_31). I'm still in the research phase, but I might want to relate my project for this class to my thesis somehow.

## Wild Card 
Could I run a laptop on alkaline batteries? I took a long time buying a [new laptop](https://frame.work) because I [don't](https://www.are.na/block/30319808) like [lithium-ion batteries](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/02/01/1152893248/red-cobalt-congo-drc-mining-siddharth-kara) and try to avoid them at all costs. 

## Headphones
Speaking of alkaline batteries in electronics, I like these headphones.

 My old headphones recently broke. I buy at least four pairs of headphones a year - wasteful! Could I design my own pair of ([active](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_noise_control)) sound-cancelling headphones designed to be repaired? 

 I am also interested in unique over ear headphone designs.

 Could I fabricate repairable sound-cancelling headphones that have a replaceable over-ear section, so that designs can be swapped out at will?

## Pianos

I love pianos. I want a piano...but I don't have the space. I always go into the Steinway & Sons store when I'm in the area.

I really like pianos that have weird shapes, or pianos that are transparent.

I wish it were possible to make a piano that can be folded into a backpack, so I could carry it around the city. I want to 3D print a piano that I can carry on the subway and through the doorway of my house without hiring movers from Steinway & Sons.
