# Week 3
**Final Project Ideation**

## Keychain Fabrication

I could just fabricate some keychains. Maybe I should aim low.

## Book Binding

How are books bound? Could I automate the binding of books/zines with [atypical](https://www.are.na/block/38616693) pages, or automate creating books/zines with [pop-out sections](https://www.are.na/block/12464774)?

I am interested in fabricating a machine that automates zine-making, *maybe*. I am *not* interested in fabricating one-off objects - I am interested in fabricating machines that make things.

I feel like this...is interesting. Not sure if it is practical, but it is interesting.

I also think it would be fun to emboss all the letters in the book and/or emboss Braille on the back of every page, for accessibility. If the goal of the fabricated machine was to create books/zines that maximize both interactivity and accessibility, that would be nice to work on.

## Wild Card 1
Could I run a laptop on alkaline batteries? I took a long time buying a [new laptop](https://frame.work) because I [don't](https://www.are.na/block/30319808) like [lithium-ion batteries](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/02/01/1152893248/red-cobalt-congo-drc-mining-siddharth-kara) and try to avoid them at all costs. 

## Headphones
Speaking of alkaline batteries in electronics, I like these headphones.

 My old headphones recently broke. I buy at least four pairs of headphones a year - wasteful! Could I design my own pair of (active) sound-canceling headphones designed to be repaired? 

 I am also interested in unique over ear headphone designs.

 Could I fabricate repairable sound-canceling headphones that have a replaceable over-ear section, so that designs can be swapped out at will?

## Wild Card 2

This idea makes me think of too many offshoots, so the scope is probably not appropriate for this course. I have been thinking about this Coperni purse for a long time, and also about the rise of streaming services/copyright law in music. 

![Coperni MP3 player purse](https://enderversing.github.io/itp-blog/assets/img/digitalfab/week3/mp3_purse_coperni.jpg)

I miss MP3 downloads and MP3 players. (I already own an ancient/vintage iPod.) This wearable MP3 player project would be a large project, though, and I know too little about music to be the person who follows through on this idea.

## Pianos

I love pianos. I want a piano...but I don't have the space. I always go into the Steinway & Sons store when I'm in the area.

I really like pianos that have weird shapes, or pianos that are transparent.

I wish it were possible to make a piano that can be folded into a backpack, so I could carry it around the city. I want to 3D print a piano that I can carry on the subway and through the doorway of my house without hiring movers from Steinway & Sons.
