**Building Web Services the REST way**

I have programmed too many REST APIs to keep track of so I am familiar with Node.js server setup when it comes to GET and POST requests.

I never learned much about PUT or DELETE requests. I also never knew that REST stood for Representational State Transfer. I thought REST was stateless, so I'm not sure why it would stand for Representational State Transfer? The Wikipedia article also describes REST architecture as stateless - hm.

I started working on my API using an LLM-assisted scraper: https://www.webhound.ai/dataset/a09554da-555b-4d2b-8bda-4c3935e7164a

My website URL will either be harriet.science or starling.directory, depending on which domain registrar is easier to work with.
