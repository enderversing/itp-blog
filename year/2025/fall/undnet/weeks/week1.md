# Week 1

Trying to acquire the Github Student plan was quite painful. I simply paid for Digital Ocean, eventually. I followed the instructions for creating the droplet outlined on the class website. I tried to turn off the droplet immediately after creating it.

At first, I was unable to turn off my Digital Ocean droplet. I had to refresh the page.

I think I misunderstood that, without a public IP address, my droplet was not at risk for being compromised yet. I was scrambling to turn off the droplet without reason.

I turned on the droplet again, and configured both ufw and iptables.

I can tell from the NYU ITP Networks site documentation that we are not expected to use both ufw and iptables at the same time. I hope I didn't break anything.

For some reason, I am forced to look at this page whenever I attempt to log into an NYU WordPress site. I don't know if this is an error page or something more insignificant. I have been directed to this page in other classes, not just Understanding Networks.

I tried to log into my droplet after a few days to check my firewall logs. I could not log in from the OS terminal or the console on the Digital Ocean website. I tried a few times throughout the day.

Right now, there's some kind of outage on the East Coast, but I'm frustrated that I couldn't finish my assignment. I wonder how I could have gone about resolving this issue.

## Reading Assignments

### How Infrastructure Shapes Us

The web design for this website is beautiful. I think it might be something about the fonts. The web designer paid attention to little details, like how the reading indicator color and font highlight color are the same.

I love thinking about infrastructure, so I'm already sold on the concept of this piece.

I'm interested in network effects. I do think about networks themselves. 

It's true that we collectively are forced to put certain items in our homes. I wouldn't say we collectively decide - I didn't make a choice to buy electricity from ConEd. The decision was made for me. I have thought about alternatives. I have thought about leaving ConEd, and brainstormed. 

I'm glad the author addressed the myth of individual action. I'm a person who thinks a lot about these things and could not come up with something I can do as an individual to escape the environmental impact of the grid.

### Why Google Went Offline Today and a Bit about How the Internet Works

I do like the immediate technical detail. Nameservers! I recognize that terminology. I thought Border Gateway Patrol was like anti-DDOS for phones? I may be misinformed.

I enjoy the "misconfiguaration" spelling error.


### We finally know what caused the global tech outage - and how much it cost

I still don't understand why UNIX computers tend to get compromised less than Windows machines. I have tried to research this before...

The irony of a cybersecurity firm's software unintentionally grounding airplanes is not lost on me.
