# Week 1



At first, I was unable to turn off my Digital Ocean droplet. I had to refresh the page.

I turned on the droplet again, and configured both ufw and iptables.

I can tell from the NYU ITP Networks site documentation that we are not expected to use both ufw and iptables at the same time. I hope I didn't break anything.

I tried to log into my droplet after a few days to check my firewall logs. I could not log in from the OS terminal or the console on the Digital Ocean website. I tried a few times throughout the day.

Right now, there's some kind of outage on the East Coast, but I'm frustrated that I couldn't finish my assignment. I wonder how I could have gone about resolving this issue.
