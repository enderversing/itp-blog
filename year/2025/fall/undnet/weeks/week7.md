# Week 7

## ITU and 3GPP

Is "data rate" the same as "bitrate"? I'm familiar with (low) bitrates from LoRa.

My interest in 5G mostly comes from its [technical intersection](https://dsp-group.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Lattice-ReductionDet.pdf) with [geometric number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_problem). I don't immediately have thoughts regarding the governance of 5G. 

Last semester I mentioned 5G in my final project about solving the dihedral hidden subgroup problem on quantum computers.


## Web Server Progress

I had office hours with Sahal ~a week ago and my web server was online...briefly. He advised me to change my A records as well as NS records, when I had previously only done the latter.
