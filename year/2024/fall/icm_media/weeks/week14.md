## Week 14

Is it Week 13 or Week 14? It's the last week.

I decided to improve upon my [Hypercinema Cornell Box](../../hypercinema/weeks/week14.md).

How can I add to this project without using pre-made software?

First I found some audio assets.

This is for the Harriet scene.

This is for the home screen/menu.

This is a nice garden sound for the dream scene.

I was having trouble actually playing the audio inside the [site](https;//blackprint.surge.sh) but Mozilla had helpful documentaion.

Finally, the audio started playing.

In order to add audio to a 3D scene, I would have had to use Unity and done this inside the engine. You could say that adding audio to a 3D environment without a dedicated game engine is an example of computational thinking or actually just an example of using the web as an engine.

The audio element looked ugly without any styling. I added CSS to make the audio element with controls into a dark-themed sticky footer.

On the pages with 3D environments, I added CSS to make the audio element with controls into a dark-themed sticky header.
