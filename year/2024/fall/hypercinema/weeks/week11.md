# Week 11

## Inspiration

This Cornell box explores the connections between darkness, galaxies, and historical Blackprints for liberation.

### Visual Inspiration

I was initially inspired by this image I saw on social media.

### Angela Davis

* The prison has become a black hole into which the detritus of contemporary capitalism is deposited. 
  * [Prison] tends to reproduce the very conditions that lead people to prison.
  * "Black holes not only swallow matter, they can also eject matter." - NASA

### Healing Justice Lineages

* Learn to listen to fire. Start with the furthest fire. The fire in the stars. Look between the stars for what you need. The untraceable black of the possible. 

* What does it mean to listen darkly? 
* What if the justice inside of our healing is not about our abilities, not about our agency, not even about our actions? What if the capacity, choice, and movement are only stars, and behind it is the dark energy of everything.
* Journeying by night barely ahead of the torches, sometimes the healing people need to trust the dark.
* When Harriet Tubman traveled through the dark again and again on fugitive journeys away from literal plantations and the plantation economy, she had to understand light better than light understood itself.

### dark energy for Harriet Tubman

1822

the Astronomical Society
of London meets
to write down what they know of stars

in eastern shore Maryland
araminta screams
into an unmeasurable life

1835

sap dark root of love
opening out your skull
praise the girl who watched the comet and knew
praise the girl who tracked the north star and knew
praise the girl who studied herself and knew one thing:

sky is a map

1844

expand the universe

open the wet reflective road
blood bashed temporal lobe

let everything that is not love
escape your skull
like so much stardust 

1849

and while they chart
the pricks of light
use night
love night
be night
free night
write night

if colonialism is a starving hunter
and slavery is a splintered pencil
go
become untraceable

1851

if all you breathe is freedom
they can’t hear you
if all you take is freedom
they can’t steal you
if all you feel is freedom
they can’t find you
if all you give is freedom
they can’t stop you
if all you love is freedom
they can’t catch you

girl you look just like freedom
they can’t see you 

1863

sing to the river
wake the people
sing to the rice fields
wake the land
sing to the trees
the vines
the moss
sing to the river
the people come running
buildings burning in their wake
like stars

1865

walk away from the broken promise
walk away like you walked before
walk away from the muddled battle
walk on into your own front door

freedom is the people you choose
the air you breathe 

1896

sometimes
the meeting room
is a night sky
you see infinite versions
of the universe
looking back at you
in each blinking face 

1910

the comet comes back
around
the ground
has changed 

1913

if you build it right
if you know the trees
if you make it sweet enough for your parents
and big enough for your community
and soon enough to live in it yourself
the old folks home can be a spaceship 

1922

somebody thinks
they can fix the cosmos
get black history down in writing
fix your image keep you there
somewhere the first and last astronomer laughs 

2022

and laughs
