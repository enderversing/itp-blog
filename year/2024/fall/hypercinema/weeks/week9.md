# Week 9

**What is interactivity to you?**


I think interactivity consists of some experience where outcomes or narrative arcs are contingent on choices made by people experiencing or interacting with the experience. I don't think is interactivity synonymous with the [spatial turn](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783839448021-012/html) in gaming.

Chris Crawford defines interactivity [in terms of actors](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/68e8ljaz0rtgqlkyr7su9/chris_crawford_theartofinteractivedesign.pdf?rlkey=zfxa8mx6kqqtk4n2z2qrkij1w&e=1&dl=0). Kate Compton, I think, defines interactivity in terms of ["reflection-in-action", or the "grokloop"](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4kg8g9gd).

Lev Manovich writes well. Chris Crawford's writing contains so little depth and foresight in comparison. I haven't finished *The Language of New Media* but I have skimmed it a couple times.

I do think that [interactivity is a myth](https://dss-edit.com/plu/Manovich-Lev_The_Language_of_the_New_Media.pdf). I love that Manovich talks about interactivity in broad and coarse strokes - literature that requires users to fill in the missing information, or - in my opinion-  [piece together the information presented into a narrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_literature), can be considered interactive.

I consider Zork interactive. GTA V is also interactive. 

Art installations are interactive. YouTube videos are not interactive.

**Does it add or detract to artmaking/storytelling - or when doesn't and when does it?**


 > Don't try to explain everything with something interactive. Use interactivity only when interactivity works best, otherwise, supplement it with text & images.

**How did the interactivity in Gone Home contribute to or change the effect of the story?**

I don't know, honestly.
