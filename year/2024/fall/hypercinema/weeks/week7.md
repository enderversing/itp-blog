# Week 7

My example of synthetic media is [Mango's recent advertising campaign](https://www.mangofashiongroup.com/en/w/mango-crea-la-primera-campaña-generada-con-inteligencia-artificial-para-su-línea-teen).

* Why do you consider this synthetic media?
  * I consider images generated by deep generative models to be synthetic.

* What can you find about how this was made (if you can)? 
  * > "a generative AI model was trained to learn how to generate images by positioning the real garments on a model."

* What are the ethical ramifications of this specific example (if any)?
  * Creative human labor (modeling) is outsourced to computers.
