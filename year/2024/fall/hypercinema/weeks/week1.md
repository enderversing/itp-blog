# Hypercinema ‚ü° Week 1

Logging into Notion to access the syllabus is troublesome. I need to login, however, to find and complete the assignments for next week.

## Assignment: Pauline Oliveros talk

I wonder how the concept of deep listening differs from mindfulness.

The deep listening exercise we did in class is similar in content and tone to mindfulness exercises I have done in the past.

Does deep listening need its own name? It seems to be an element of mindfulness.

## Assignment: Haley Shaw interview

This is very helpful and detailed! I would like to learn more about [sound design in the context of video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEZA_Framework). 

I like Haley Shaw's delineation between "diegetic" and "non-diegetic" sounds because this language is also used to describe video game audio.
