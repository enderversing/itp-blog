# Week 7

This is all that I documented regarding the physical device I made (the OLED screen turning on for the first time).

I also am adding a bird's eye view of the breadboard before I soldered everything together. I wish I had filmed a video of what this looked like when I turned it on.

I showed this to the class as a digital PDF presentation and a physical pamphlet. I'm having some technical issues so I will upload each image embedded in the PDF one by one.
