# Week 5


## Meshtastic + LoRa Pager Project

Which to buy?
* [Rak nRF52840](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak4631-lpwan-node?srsltid=AfmBOorAtv1PSKK1e-q3Ws-wbv0UbaP2Ilashxq5Ety-rdoCcQK-eisZ&variant=37505443987654)
  * This is probably the best one - but which variant?
  * (This version consumes less energy than ESP32 variants, making it better for solar power endeavors.)
* SenseCAP Card Tracker T1000-E
  * I can't even find a link to purchase this...

Okay, I bought Rak Wireless boards (and two of everything).

I bought a supercapacitor and then realized it's not going to work out...maybe another project can use the supercapacitors?

I tried to purchase every electronic component that seemed relevant to making a LoRa pager. I bought two *real time clocks*, *buzzers*, and keypads.

 I even bought (2) SD cards for storing contacts on the pagers! 

I think my teammate's idea - making physical contact cards for sharing LoRa pager contact information - would be really fun. It would be like a business card but informal.

I took these notes about the LoRa pager to share for our group meeting, so were all on the same page (I was wrong about the power supply):

We will not engage with the Halloween theme (if it is up to me, at least).

## [Lab: Using a Transistor to Control High Current Loads with an Arduino](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/motors-and-transistors/using-a-transistor-to-control-high-current-loads-with-an-arduino/)



First, I tested the potentiometer's ability to vary in resistance by making a simple circuit that wasn't part of the lab.

Then - after hours, after coming to school in the early morning, and working until just before class - I read a schematic for the first time.

My professor helped me understand how to read schematics in the lab tutorials instead of relying on the semi-representational breadboard views. 

I think the breadboard views have started to be more confusing than the schematics. I'm so grateful to my professor and shop staff for helping me finish 1/4 labs due this week right before class.

I think completing labs by following schematics instead of breadboard views might help me gain an intuition for this subject and/or perform better in class.

I'm trying to document my thought process beyond saying "I did it" and moving on. 

I thought it was interesting that I forgot to connect the high current circuit to the Arduino at first - after being confused about how to power the circuit for so long, I forgot that I needed to program the behavior of the circuit.

I think I learned that transistors are like pushbuttons, but can be programmed. Apparently transistors are [part of / can be used to make] logic gates, which I find interesting.
