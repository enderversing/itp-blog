# Week 12

I met with Josh on Friday (because Kai was not available) to discuss how to make an enclosure. Josh encouraged me to change the shape from a clamshell (too organic, round) to something more rectangular (I suggested a Sandy Liang-esque flower motif) but I haven't given up on the clamshell design for the enclosure quite yet.

I'm going to try to get to school early-ish on Monday to work on my enclosure. I have fallen behind but I have new ideas!

This (below) is the enclosure design Josh said would be too difficult to make:

This is the back up enclosure (below) I might shift to:

 Imagine a rectangle with the shape of this Sandy Liang scrunchie (no hole in the middle) for the edges instead of straight lines for edges.

I might try making both enclosures so that I don't run out of time. If all goes (more!) wrong, I could just focus on the flower motif enclosure.
