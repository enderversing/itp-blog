# Week 12

I met with Josh on Friday (because Kai was not available) to discuss how to make an enclosure. Josh encouraged me to change the shape from a clamshell (too organic, round) to something more rectangular (I suggested a Sandy Liang-esque flower motif) but I haven't given up on the clamshell design for the enclosure quite yet.

I'm going to try to get to school early-ish on Monday to work on my enclosure. I have fallen behind but I have new ideas!
