## [Emotional Design: Attractive Things Work Better](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/reader.action?docID=876410)

Emotions change how we think. Emotions are part of cognition, though, George Lakoff would say  - so I'm not surprised. I think this chapter makes a good argument for why emotions are part of cognition.

Three levels of processing:
* visceral
  * referred to as "lizard brain" in a documentary I remember watching
  * fast
  * can compete with reflective kinds of pleasure
  * rapid value judgements
    * safe vs. dangerous
    * good vs. bad
  * activity initiated from this level is "bottom-up"
    * driven by perception
* behavioral
  * most human behavior is at this level
  * muscle memory of playing piano (for skilled pianists)
  * physical, sensory pleasure
* reflective
  * looks over the lower levels of processing   
    * tries to control behavioral level of processing
    * (metacognition?)
  * pleasure derived from meaning
    * ex: art
  * activity initiated from this level is "top-down"
    * driven by thought

* negative affect intensifies focus and attention to detail
  * positive affect makes [some?? who specifically?] people more receptive to novelty
  
* the list of things that produce negative vs. positive affect sound like a description of urban vs. rural environments

* sound can modulate, control affect
