# Week 1
`9.5.24`

It's the first week! 

Duties to complete before next week:
* share link to this blog in class spreadsheet
* read Bret Victor + Timo Arnall pieces
* complete interactive electronics labs

I wanted to make a mecha suit previously - explained in [[fall/index]] - but now I feel that I may want to make a game console designed for interactive fiction instead.

I'm thinking tangible computing. My ideas may change further.
