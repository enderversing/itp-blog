I got the two radios to come "online" but they haven't found each other yet.

The LoRa radios are talking to each other! I have made so much progress.

## If you're reading this...

I need a better way to organize my code in the Arduino IDE! It's hideous and difficult to look through.

I am asking for assistance and help regarding organization of code written for the Arduino Nano 33 IoT.

I'm not sure whether it will be better to write the "operating system" or solder parts together first. Either way, writing that much code will require me to have a real system in place.

I'm getting to the point where I'm scared of the code I wrote the day before.
